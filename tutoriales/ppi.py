    """Function to run one simulation of the Policy Priority Inference model.

    Parameters
    ----------
        I0: numpy array 
            Initial values of the development indicators.
        alphas: numpy array
            Vector with parameters representing the structural 
            factors of each indicator. If not provided, the structurral factors are
            assumed to have value 1 for all indicators.
        betas: numpy array
            Vector with parameters that normalize the public
            in an indicator into a success probabiity for its growth trial.
        A:  2D numpy array (default: a matrix full of zeros)
            The adjacency matrix of the spillover network of development 
            indicators. If not given, the model assumes a zero-matrix, so there 
            are no spillovers.
        R:  numpy array (default: a vector with ones)
            Vector that specifies whether an indicator is instrumental (1 or True)
            or collateral (0 or False).
        bs: numpy array (default: a vector full of ones)
            Vector with modulating factors for the budgetary allocation of
            each instrumental indicator.
        qm: numpy array (default: a vector full of 0.5)
            Vector with parametrs capturing the quality of the monitoring 
            mechanisms for each instrumental indicator. If the quality of 
            monitoring is an indicator for the model, then qm should be an integer
            corresponding to the index of the indicator.
        rl: numpy array (default: a vector full of 0.5)
            Vector with parametrs capturing the quality of the rule of law 
            mechanisms for each instrumental indicator. If the rule of 
            law is an indicator for the model, then rl should be an integer
            corresponding to the index of the indicator.
        Imax: numpy array
            Vector with the technical upper bounds of the indicators. It an entry
            contains a missing value (NaN), then there is no upper bound defined
            for that indicator and it will grow indefinitely.
        Bs: numpy ndarray (default: a vector with 10e6 in every entry)
            Disbursement schedule across expenditure programs for the entire
            simulation. In its 2D form, rows represent the expenditure programs 
            and columnts the simulation periods. If provided as a single number 
            or as a single-dimensional vector, it is assumed that there
            is only one expenditure program: the entire budget.
        B_dict: dictionary (keys must be integers and values must be lists)
            A dictionary that maps the indices of every indicator into a list
            with the associated expenditure programs. Every instrumental indicator
            must be associated to at least one expenditure program. Collateral
            indicators shuold map into empty lists. The expenditure programs
            should be integers matching the indices of the rows in Bs when 
            provided as a 2D array.
        G: numpy array
            The development goals to be achieved for each indicator.
        T: int
            The maximum number of simulation periods. If Bs is provided, then T
            is overwritten by the number of periods implied by the dirsbursement 
            schedule.
        scalar: float
            The factor by which the indicators may be scaled. It is necessary 
            if the indicators (I0 and Imax) are not in the [0,1] range.
        frontier: numpy array
            
        
    Returns
    -------
        tsI: 2D numpy array
            Matrix with the time series of the simulated indicators. Each column 
            corresponds to a simulation step.
        tsC: 2D numpy array
            Matrix with the time series of the simulated contributions. Each column 
            corresponds to a simulation step.
